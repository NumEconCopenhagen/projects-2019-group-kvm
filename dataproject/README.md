# Data analysis Project: The effect of GDP on unemployment

In this project we are looking at the correlation between the growth in GDP and the unemployment. We will investigate if a higher GDP leads to lower unemployment which is stated by Okuns Law. Specifically we will see if the relationship holds for the United States. We will study data taken from The World Bank for the time periode 1992-2017. We will look at the development in each variable seperately and together.  We will also calculate the correlation between them and investigate by using regression.

Outline of the data analysis project:
1. Import data.

2. Sort and clean data sets.

3. Analyze the data
